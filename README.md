CSE 360 - Health Tracker
========================

*Health Tracker* is meant to store any health information which any user may
wish to record, and display it in a useful manner. Each type of health
information should be able to be recorded, yet must be able to be broken
up into different categories for convenient viewing. Once enough data is
recorded, the user will be able to view a graph showing and comparing all
of the health information they entered previously, and they will be able to 
use that data  to make important health decision.
